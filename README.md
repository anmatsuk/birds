# birds
A project aimed at reducing the amount of time and overhead taken up by starting a new code project. My script sets up the initial git repository, lays out the structure and initial Makefile and inc/[header].h files. Then I include other code libraries as needed and prompt the user for the remotes that this project will be pushed to. My work is focused primarily on C project initialization (I included an extensive BASH script to pre-generate a Makefile with all of the compilation flags and libraries included).
